# Software Definition

1. This software is a module encapsulated within a command-line interface (CLI) application.

2. It manages a list of emojis.

3. The emoji list can be sourced from multiple configurable sources. By default, an inbuilt source is provided as a remote JSON file containing emoji data.

4. All emoji sources are registered in a `sources.json` file, located within a configuration directory named `.gitmojigo` in the user's system home directory.

5. The application requires the configuration directory and its relevant files (such as `sources.json`) to exist for proper operation. If these are missing, the application will create them automatically upon execution.

6. The software supports parsing emoji data from various sources, using source-specific parsing logic as needed.

7. For the default source, the parser expects a JSON array where each emoji entry contains fields such as the emoji character, description, category, aliases, tags, and version information.

8. When a source is used for the first time, its data is downloaded and cached locally within a `sources/default/` directory, unless already present.

9. The application employs multiple strategies to extract and utilize emoji metadata, enabling intelligent matching and suggestions for users.

10. The software provides a `random` operation, which outputs a single random emoji from the list, and nothing else.

11. The software provides a `suggestion` operation, which takes a string input and, using simple and efficient regular expression patterns, outputs a single emoji that most likely fits the input string. Only the emoji is output, and the matching is optimized for real-time usage.
